                <div class="project_content">
                    <p>The portfolio project is the website you are on right now! This was a project for the workplace learning 1 subject. The beginning of the project started with sketches and brainstorming on the design and info display in figma. This was difficult since figma was very nex to my previous experience and I had missed the beginning weeks due to jaw surgery, which made recovering from the missed knowledge a stressfull experience. Still I had fun making this! Choosing the theme, listening to feedback from fellow students and adapting to that feedback has made me really love design even more then I already did!</p>

                    <p>This was a project made for my Graphic Skills 1 subject. We were tasked with replicating a visual, using knowledge we gathered from photoshop classes. As someone who has never touched anything from Adobe and has only used HTML, CSS, and hard-code, this was an exhilerating new experience for me! I've always loved photo editing since I had used GIMP in my free time and this was such a blast to do, although be it with issues along the way. And it turned out pretty great in my opinion!</p>

                    <p>This was a website I made in my first college, UCLL, for the front-end subject. We got to choose our own subject to base the website upon and I have always been fascinated with game development. Anomaly Unknown is a game I've always thought about making but never actually developed so I thought making a website about it would've turned that dream-project at least a bit into a reality!</p>
