            <h1>The 12 Learning Objectives:</h1>
            <h2>Role: Creative Designer</h2>
            <p>Understanding the final objective when it came to building the website was clear to me. However, designing it was a challenge, since I still don't quite mastered figma yet. I have a lot of work to do and might even have to redo the subject, I learned from my mistakes and should plan way more ahead. I did have fun being creative! Using the planets for each skill was a blast! I did think about user friendliness, adapting my horrible figma designs to also be readable on phone screens and be less cluttered up. I integrated digital assets by using a icon library from Font Awesome and combining the planet images myself in photoshop.</p>
            <h2>Role: Front-End Developer</h2>
            <p>I integrated data dynamically by making sure that if I do plan to add or delete skills, the css and data structure will stay intact and dynamically grow without breaking the integrals. I do have to work on my planning A TON though. Planning has never been my strong side and it unfortuantely showed.</p>
            <h2>Role: Communicator / Team Player</h2>
            <p>English is never a problem for me. I use it daily and can communicate in both Dutch and English to coworkers. However the way I write commits could use some fine tuning, since my commits tend to be quite broad and vague at times. I try to keep everything comprehensible for people with a lot of IT-experience but also technologically vulnerable people. I also really enjoyed the feedback sessions I attended, they are incredibly insightful and I love speaking AND listening to people with different perspectives on the subject matter.</p>
            <h2>Role: Life-long Learner</h2>
            <p>I could use a few training lessons on how to study better and improve my learning techniques... Improving is definitely going to take some time, and maybe even result in me having to do an extra year, but if that's what it takes, then so be it! Beside from that, I play close attention to the things I use in my projects, to make sure guidelines regarding privacy and copyright are followed. I have a lot of room to grow and need to find someone to help me grow more efficiently...</p>

            <h1>End Reflection</h1>
            <h2>AIM-Reflection</h2>
            <p>What did I like about WPL1? Meeting new people and listening do different perspectives! Aside from being creative I find it really interesting how I can go: "WOW I'm really proud of this, and still someone will have something to point at that is imperfect or flawed, which i highly appreciate! Also of course, being allowed full creativity is a dream to work! I should be cautious though since I will have to tone down a bit on the actual workspace, but working with other people sounds extremely exciting thanks to this subject!</p>
            <p>What did I like less? The fact that I was hit hard with harsh reality about planning. I am a terrible planner and in a work field where planning is ludicrously important, I have a long way to go. Combine that with the fact I have a severe case of procrastination and you get a lot of stress and frustration. Also now using A.I. (which is something I've never done before) proved difficult at times, since the agent would constantly mess things up or be simply annoying while writing my own code.</p>
            <p>Which new insights do I take with me out of WPL1? Like described previously, the insights I'm taking with me are that working with other people is super fun, but also that planning is more important than anticipated and that continuous development is a must.</p>
            <p>A personal success is, to be honest, that I was able to finish the website even though I was under huge amounts of stress. Which is something I should take with me. Although being "proud" about that sounds like self-sabotage. If anything, I'm most proud about how I can now see my mistakes and reflect on them thoroughly.</p>

            <h1>What do I take with me to WPL2?</h1>
            <h2>Core Quadrant:</h2>
            <p>A core quality of mine stays the same: my ability to work together with all kinds of people, whether I like them or not. For example: I really enjoyed the company of people giving me feedback, but there was someone from a different group that constantly had critiques on my designs and as someone who's a bit introverted, this stung a little, but even in the end, I learned to appreciate his perspective to try and adapt to it. But of course I must remember the trap of this core quality: I can't make everyone happy, there will ALWAYS be someone unhappy with a design, feature, etc. I can't let myself become FULLY dependent on my team either, that would make projects way longer then they have to be. The challenge is to try and adapt to feedback whilst also maintaining my own vision and integrity. And the allergy is that I won't be willing to work with other people anymore, which is something to massively avoid. Teamwork is key in our field, I have been taught.</p>

            <h1>Reflection over the X-Factor</h1>
            <h2>Passion</h2>
            <p>My passions came to show when actually building the website, using personal projects as references to this page and being able to show all my work in one place is quite something i'm proud of. That's why I tried to pour as much of it in here as possible, have a little collection log of my achievements and interests. They have defined me to who I am now.</p>
            <h2>Enterprising and innovative</h2>
            <p>I have tried to make this website as professional as possible, I want to further utilise this space even after school, or even if I get bad grades, I still think this is an amazing template to keep building on, may that be to upgrade it fully and learn from it, or build upon it and show it to an actual employer at some point. (Although maybe don't show an employer this work in progress yet)</p>
            <h2>Internationally working together</h2>
            <p>I've worked with people from the classes, however I've also contacted multiple people from my previous institutions. And although that probably wasn't appreciated by the teachers, I felt like it was still important to be able to do. The fact I was able to collaborate with people OUTSIDE of school, is an important social skill to have, may it be someone you've known for years or someone you just met a few minutes ago. Again, I'm introverted, so speaking to the new people in my class who I didn't know was difficult at first, but once the ball was rolling, it was rolling alright. I like networking with people that share the same interests as me. Or are the least slightly interested in what I have to say or show.</p>
            <h2>Multi & -disciplinarity</h2>
            <p>On this branch, it's not really something I can say "oh yeah that was definitely there!" during this period. It felt more like it was something that constantly poked me in the back, especially with the procrastination issues. I can say for sure it did show up when it comes to REFLECTING on having discipline. I notice I have to work out a lot of things, mentally and routine-wise, which is going to be a hassle, however I can also say now that I should push on and learn from this.</p>
